# Library Simulator System

## Project Overview

This project is a university assignment developed by Daniel Brauła and Bartosz Jasiński. It is a console-based bookshop management system implemented using object-oriented programming principles in C++. The system allows users to manage the bookshop through a series of terminal commands.

## Features

- Console-based user interface.
- User interactions via numeric inputs (0-9) or specific item names based on console prompts.
- Object-oriented design for better modularity and maintenance.

## Architecture

The project is structured into several key components:

- **Source Code (`src/`)**: Contains all the main implementation files for the project.
- **HTML (`html/`)**: Likely contains documentation or reports related to the project.
- **Tests (`tests/`)**: Contains test files to ensure the correctness of the implementation.
- **Configuration (`.vscode/`, `.gitignore`)**: Configuration files for development environment and version control.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code (indicated by `.vscode` folder)
- **Version Control**: Git (indicated by `.gitignore` file)

## How to Run

To run the bookshop management system, follow these steps:

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
2. Execute the compiled program through a terminal.
3. Interact with the bookshop system using numbers (0-9) or type specific item names as prompted by the console messages.
